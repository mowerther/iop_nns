This folder is the destination for model estimates and metrics created with the [train_nn.py](../train_nn.py) script.

Model estimates are saved in separate folders for each model instance (typically 25).
Metric tables summarising the different instances are saved here, to be used in selecting the best model and overall analysis.

The model estimates used in the paper are available from
