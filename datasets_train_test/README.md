This folder contains the *in situ* data split into random, within-distribution, and out-of-distribution scenarios.
Please note that the remote sensing reflectance columns (`Rrs`) in these files have already been scaled using sklearn's `RobustScaler`.

Data will be made available upon publication of the paper.
