This folder contains the data for the enhanced GLORIA random split, within-distribution split, and out-of-distribution split scenarios.
Please note that the remote sensing reflectance columns (`Rrs`) in these files have been scaled using sklearn's `RobustScaler`.

Data will be made available upon publication of the paper.
