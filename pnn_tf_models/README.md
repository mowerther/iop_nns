This folder is the destination for TensorFlow/KERAS models created with the [train_nn.py](../train_nn.py) script.

Models are saved in separate folders for each model instance (typically 25).
Use the combined metric table saved to the [estimates folder](../pnn_model_estimates) to select the best model instance.
