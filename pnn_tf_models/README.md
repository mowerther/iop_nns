This folder contains the TensorFlow/KERAS models created with the [train_nn.py](../train_nn.py) script.

The models are saved in separate folders for each model instance (typically 25).
Use the combined metric table in the [predictions folder](../pnn_model_estimates) to select the best model instance.
