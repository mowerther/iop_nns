This folder is the destination for TensorFlow/KERAS models created with the [train_nn.py](../train_nn.py) script.

Models are saved in separate folders for each model instance (typically 25).
Use the combined metric table saved to the [estimates folder](../pnn_model_estimates) to select the best model instance.

The models used in the paper are available from
[Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.14893798](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14893798).
